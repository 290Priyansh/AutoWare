## 📖 Why I Built This

I’ve never liked leaving my PC on overnight, especially when I'm running long processes. One day while training a machine learning model late at night, I wanted the system to shut down automatically after a couple of hours — without me having to stay awake for it. So, I wrote this simple AutoShutdown script to solve that exact problem. It now helps me save electricity, avoid overheating, and keep things clean and safe.
